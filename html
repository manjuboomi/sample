<p>In this paper,3 several of us involved in the development and evolution of the 
Internet share our views of its origins and history. This history revolves around 
four distinct aspects. There is the technological evolution that began with early 
research on packet switching and the<em> ARPANET</em> (and related technologies), and where
current research continues to expand the horizons of the infrastructure along several
dimensions, such as scale, performance, and higher-level functionality. There is the
operations and management aspect of a<strong> global and complex operational infrastructure</strong>. 
There is the social aspect, which resulted in a broad community of Internauts working 
together to create and evolve the technology. And there is the commercialization aspect,
resulting in an extremely effective transition of research results into a broadly deployed 
and available information infrastructure.

<p>The Internet today is a widespread information infrastructure, the initial prototype of
what is often called the National (or Global or Galactic) <em>Information Infrastructure</em>. Its 
history is complex and involves many aspects â€“ technological, organizational, and community.
And its influence reaches not only to the technical fields of computer communications but 
throughout society as we move toward increasing use of online tools to accomplish electronic
commerce, information acquisition, and community operations. </p>

<p> A major shift occurred as a result of the increase in scale of the Internet and its
 associated management issues</p>

<p>As the Internet evolved, one of the major challenges was how to propagate the changes to
the software, particularly the<em> host software</em>. DARPA supported UC Berkeley to investigate 
modifications to the Unix operating system, including incorporating TCP/IP developed at BBN.
Although Berkeley later rewrote the BBN code to more efficiently fit into the Unix system and
kernel, the incorporation of TCP/IP into the Unix BSD system releases proved to be a critical
element in dispersion of the protocols to the research community. Much of the CS research 
community began to use Unix BSD for their day-to-day computing environment. Looking back, the
strategy of incorporating Internet protocols into a supported operating system for the research 
community was one of the key elements in the successful widespread adoption of the Internet.</p>
